## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid



### What I learned

Another experience setting up CSS grids.

The upper portion of the page is set as "explicit grid"

For the lower portion of the page, used an "implicit grid" approach, with a few lines of code.

```css
 grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(330px, 1fr));
```


### Continued development

Continue improving my coding skills by developing challenging applications, like this one.

### Useful resources

Miscellaneous video tutorials on CSS grid, as well as w3schools.com and developer.mozilla.org.
